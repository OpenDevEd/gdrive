## Getting Google Credentials for Google Drive API
  
The script has links to the API docs in it.

Follow these steps to get your Google Credentials for Google Drive API:

#### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console

First, navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

#### Step 2: Create a New Project

![Create New Project](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Li8oIH9iWyWmq4GhFfBcfA.png)

Click on the "Select a project" dropdown, then click on "NEW PROJECT". Give your project a name and click "CREATE".

#### Step 3: Enable Google Drive API

![Enable Google Drive API](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*44xNkyL3LPsSwMr4G9IC-A.png)

In the Dashboard, click on "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES". Search for "Google Drive API" and click on it. Then click "ENABLE".

#### Step 4: Create Credentials

![Create Credentials](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*zgiH8WBmrd68UOjVg3I1uQ.png)

Go back to the Dashboard and click on "Credentials" in the left-hand menu. Click on "CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "OAuth client ID".

#### Step 5: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

![Configure OAuth Consent Screen](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*u4PWb9EyMYhbUwby2Jk7Ug.png)

You'll be asked to configure the OAuth consent screen. Fill in the necessary details and click "SAVE".

#### Step 6: Create OAuth Client ID

![Create OAuth Client ID](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*pcjpbnNcv_UjBdBOzskkJQ.png)

Select "Web application" as the Application type. Give it a name and add your redirect URIs, then click "CREATE".

#### Step 7: Download Credentials

![Download Credentials](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*V4EeM45vm63htFxb67beMQ.png)

You'll see a screen with your client ID and client secret. Click on the download icon to download your credentials in a JSON file.

And that's it! You now have your Google Credentials for Google Drive API.

#### Step 8: Sign in

When you first run `bgdrive`, you'll need to log in. `bgdrive` presents you with a link, which you open. Once you have signed in, you'll get a redirect to 'localhost' (which won't work). However, you can read off the code from that url. Paste that code into the terminal as prompted.

You're now ready to use `bgdrive`!
